In an interview with PTI, Chidambaram also said every effort should be made and will be made to forge unity among the Opposition parties in the upcoming presidential polls. Asked about the ED summons to Rahul and Sonia Gandhi and the Congress\u2019 decision of a show of strength when the former appears before the investigative agency on Monday, Chidambaram said, \u201cI speak as a Congress member and an advocate. The ED\u2019s summons to Mr Rahul Gandhi under PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) is baseless.\u201d Pointing out that the offence of money laundering requires \u2018money\u2019 and \u2018laundering of money\u2019, the former home minister said that in the National Herald debt-to-equity conversion, something which lending banks do on a regular basis, there was no transaction of money. Therefore, how can there be money laundering, he asked. \u201cIt is like accusing a person of the offence of \u2018purse snatching\u2019 when there was no purse and no snatching,\u201d he argued. As Congress members, Chidambaram said, party leaders will express solidarity with Rahul Gandhi and march with him to the ED\u2019s office on Monday.
